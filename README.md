Crime Data Analysis Dashboard
Hello guys 
if u want to see the implementation of working of crime data
u have to download the run.py and app.py and .csv files all there in the files
so to run the file
1.) for run.py it is made using streamlit so while running make sure it must run with "streamlit run run.py" 
2.) for file app.py is run through " python app.py" 
and these both run in cmd (Command Prompt)

Make sure all the required files must be in  same directory so that u can run same file one after the other in the same cmd.
Try it and enjoy the visualization of inserting any crime data and make ur own visual like power bi and u can  add and modify by adding rows and column and report is generate by going to top right cornor beside deploy there there is dots like 
":" click it and there will be options to download the files.
Make sure run it properly with all i mentioned above steps.
